# This pipeline can be manually run or is automatically triggered whenever one 
# of the following conditions is true:
# - a push is made to any branch in the repository (not only 'master')
# - a pull request is created
# - a tag named 'latest' is pushed
# Note. In the last case, the tag can be (re-)created using the Git CLI, e.g.:
#    git push -f origin <abfb967>:refs/tags/latest
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - '*'

# This pipeline has been implemented to be run on hosted agent pools based both
# on 'windows' and 'ubuntu' virtual machine images and using the scripts defined
# in the package.json file. Since we are deploying on Azure functions on Windows
# runtime, the pipeline is currently configured to use a Windows hosted image for
# the build and deploy.
